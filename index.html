                  <p>Watching the news, it is easy to imagine that college campuses have become synonymous with
                  protest, violence, and the oppression of free speech. Is there actually evidence to show that support for
                  free speech is dwindling on America's college campuses?</p>

                      <p>In the summer of 1787, politicians gathered in Philadelphia to draft a new Constitution. Part of this new
                      Constitution was the Bill of Rights, a bill that would safeguard basic civil rights. This Bill
                      consisted of 10 rights and became the first ten amendments of the US Constitution. The Bill of Rights
                      was introduced to Congress in 1789 and adopted on December 15th, 1791.</p>
                      <p>The First Amendment protects the freedoms of speech, assembly, religion, petition, and the press.
                      This does not mean there are not reasonable restrictions. Speech provoking action that may directly harm
                      people, such as making specific threats or shouting fire in a theatre, is not protected. Additionally, the press
                      cannot make false statements, known as libel. Freedom of Religion means that states cannot
                      have a state religion nor can they promote one religion above any others. Finally, Right to Assembly and
                      Petition can cover anything from signing a petition to filing a lawsuit against the government.</p>

                    <div class="col-6" id="event-info">
                        The Free Speech Movement, was a large-scale student protest on the campus of University of
                        California, Berkeley. Lead by Mario Savio, it was started in response to an administrative
                        decision to ban political activism on campus. On December 2nd 1964, around 4000 students sat in
                        Sproul Hall as a last resort to negotiate with administrators. Over 800 students were arrested
                        and it took police officers over 12 hours to clear the hallways. The Free Speech Movement is
                        seen as the birthplace of student activism on campuses. It has been critiqued for the
                        methodology, however, as it prevented other students who did not want to participate in the
                        sit-ins and protests from receiving an education.

                <p>You've probably heard about speakers being protested or shut down, especially on college
                campuses, for their controversial views. Over time, attitudes about allowing people with
                different opinions to speak has changed. <a href="https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/pages/show?page=gss%2Fabout">The General Social Survey</a> asks people
                    from different backgrounds and age ranges from around the United States questions about social issues. Some questions are
                    about attitudes towards free speech, and more specifically, whether people with different views should
                    be allowed to speak.</p>

                    ranks colleges according to how the college's
                administrators allow free speech on campus. A college ranked <span class="red">red</span>  has one or more
                    policies that
                substantially and clearly restrict free speech. An example of this would be having a blanket ban on
                    'verbal abuse'. A college colored <span class="white">white</span> college has one or more policies that inhibit free speech, but
                on a much smaller scope, like banning posters that mention drink or drugs. <span class="blue">
                        Blue</span> colleges have a hands off approach to free speech. However, this does not mean
                    the college encourages free speech or that its students support free speech.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Only <span class="white">10%</span> of colleges have a blue ranking (with

          <div class="col-6" id="conclusion-info">
              <h1 class="first-title">Are today's colleges any more adverse to free speech? Not really.</h1>
              <p>Whilst it may seem from constant news reports that college students today are more
              adverse to free speech, that is not the case. In fact, overall attitudes to free speech have improved over time and those who
              are old are less likely to permit controversial speakers. However, colleges are implementing
              more and more free speech restricting policies. Those that are trying to shut down speakers
              are doing so in more violent means than ever before, requiring colleges to cater to their needs
              and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on security.</p>
              <p>Unlike in previous generations, the majority of students are pro-free speech, but a dangerous and sometimes
              violent minority may be controlling the discussion about the First Amendment on US campuses.</p>
              <p>There have been proposals to reduce federal aid to institutions that do not uphold the First Amendment,
              but this unfairly harms students and gives the government more control over colleges.</p>
              <p>We think the best system is for the silent majority to step out of the shadows, to support
              the invitations of controversial speakers, whilst protesting what they disagree with. It must be made clear
              that there is a large difference between giving someone the ability to speak and agreeing with what they say.</p>
